# The Splunk Software Development Kit for Ruby (Preview Release)

This SDK contains library code and examples designed to enable developers to
build applications using Splunk.

Splunk is a search engine and analytic environment that uses a distributed
map-reduce architecture to efficiently index, search and process large 
time-varying data sets.

The Splunk product is popular with system administrators for aggregation and
monitoring of IT machine data, security, compliance and a wide variety of 
other scenarios that share a requirement to efficiently index, search, analyze
and generate real-time notifications from large volumes of time series data.

The Splunk developer platform enables developers to take advantage of the 
same technology used by the Splunk product to build exciting new applications
that are enabled by Splunk's unique capabilities.

## Getting started with the Splunk Ruby SDK

The Splunk Ruby SDK contains code and some examples that show how to
programattically interact with Splunk for a variety of scenarios including
searching, saved searches, configuration and many more. It's still not quite 
complete and things like Inputs are missing.  Stay tuned.

### Getting Started

Here's what you need to get going with the Splunk Ruby SDK.

#### Splunk

If you haven't already installed Splunk, download it here: 
http://www.splunk.com/download. For more about installing and running Splunk 
and system requirements, see Installing & Running Splunk 
(http://dev.splunk.com/view/SP-CAAADRV).

#### Splunk Ruby SDK

Get the Splunk Ruby SDK from GitHub (https://github.com) and clone the
resources to your computer.  Use the following command:

    git clone https://github.com/splunk/splunk-sdk-ruby.git

#### Installing

We highly recommend that you use _bundler_. See http://gembundler.com/ for more 
info.

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    gem 'splunk-sdk-ruby'

And then execute:

    $ bundle

If you are not using bundler, than you can install it like this:

    $ gem build splunk-sdk-ruby.gemspec
    $ gem install splunk-sdk-ruby

#### Requirements

The Splunk Ruby SDK requires Ruby 1.9.2 or greater.

#### Running the Unit Tests

We are adding more unit tests all the time.  For now, run what we have.

Edit the ~/.splunkrc file (/home/_username_/.splunkrc) to use
the Splunk admin role's username and password, and the management port,
host and protocol of your Splunk Server.

[TODO: Insert .splunkrc description from other SDK README]

To protect your Splunk password, you may want to delete this file when
you are done running the unit tests.

In the base directory where you installed the Splunk Ruby SDK, run

    $ rake test

It should run many tests without error.

To generate the code coverage of the test suite, run

    $ rake test COVERAGE=true

It will produce a directory called coverage. Open coverage/index.html to
see the coverage report.

Note that currently, the only examples are documented in-line with the code.  
They can be seen by pointing your browser to

    http://splunk.github.com/splunk-sdk-ruby/doc/Splunk/Service.html

## Overview 

The Splunk library included in this SDK consists of two layers of API that 
can be used to interact with splunkd - the _binding_ layer and the 
_client_ layer.

#### A word about XML

Ruby ships with the REXML library be default, but for most real world work,
you will want to use Nokogiri, which is orders of magnitude faster. The Splunk
Ruby SDK supports both. By default it will try to use Nokogiri, and fall back
to REXML if Nokogiri is not available. The value of the library in use is
kept in the global variable `$splunk_xml_library` (which will be either `:nokogiri`
or `:rexml`).

You can force your program to use a particular library by calling
require_xml_library(_library_) (where, again, _library_ is either `:nokogiri`
or `:rexml`). This method is in `lib/splunk_sdk_ruby/xml_shim.rb`, but will be
included when you include the whole SDK.

If you force your program to use a particular library, the SDK will no longer
try to fall back to REXML, but will issue a LoadError, on the assumption that
if you really wanted Nokogiri that badly, we should probably tell you if you
don't get it.

#### The Binding Layer
This is the lowest layer of the Splunk Ruby SDK. It is a thin wrapper around 
low-level HTTP capabilities, including:

* Authentication and namespace URL management
* Accessible low-level HTTP interface for use by developers who want
    to be close to the wire.
* Atom Response parser

Here is a simple example of using the binding layer. This example makes a REST 
call to Splunk returning an Atom feed of all users defined in the system:

    require 'splunk-sdk-ruby'

    c = Splunk::Context.new(:username => "admin", :password => 'password', :protocol => 'https').login
    puts c.get('authentication/users') #Will spit out an ATOM feed in XML

Here is another example, but this time we convert the Atom feed to much cleaner
JSON:

    require 'splunk-sdk-ruby'

    c = Splunk::Context.new(:username => "admin", :password => 'password', :protocol => 'https').login
    users = Splunk::AtomResponseLoader::load_text(c.get('authentication/users')) #Will spit out JSON
    puts users['feed']['updated']

If you wish you can use _dot accessors_ to access the individual elements as 
long as they aren't in an Array: 

    require 'splunk-sdk-ruby'

    c = Splunk::Context.new(:username => "admin", :password => 'password', :protocol => 'https').login
    users =  Splunk::AtomResponseLoader::load_text_as_record(c.get('authentication/users')) #Will spit out clean JSON
    puts users.feed.updated             #Works
    puts users.feed.entry[0].title      #Throws exception
    puts users.feed.entry[0]['title']   #Works 

#### The Client Layer
The _client_ layer builds on the _binding_ layer to provide a friendlier 
interface to Splunk that abstracts away many of the lower level details of the 
_binding_ layer.  It currently abstracts the following (with more to come):

* Authentication
* Apps
* Capabilities
* Server Info
* Loggers
* Settings
* Indexes
* Roles
* Users
* Jobs
* Searching (One-shot, Asynchronous, Real-Time, etc.)
* Restarting
* Configuration
* Messages
* Collections and Entities

Here is a simple example of using the binding layer.  This example is the same 
as in the _binding_ layer. It returns all users in the system and displays 
their names:

    svc = Splunk::Service.connect(:username => 'admin', :password => 'password')
    svc.users.each {|user| puts user.name}
