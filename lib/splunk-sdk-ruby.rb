# The Splunk SDK for Ruby provides an idiomatic interface to Splunk
# from Ruby. To use it, add
#
#     require 'splunk-sdk-ruby'
#
# to the top of your source file. All the code in the SDK is in the +Splunk+
# module. Once you have included the SDK, create a connection to your Splunk
# instance with (changing host, port, username, and password to your values):
#
#     service = Splunk::Service.new(:host => "localhost",
#                                   :port => 8089,
#                                   :username => "admin",
#                                   :password => "changeme").login()
