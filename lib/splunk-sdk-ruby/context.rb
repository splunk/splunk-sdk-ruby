  # Class encapsulating a connection to a Splunk server.
  #
  # This class is used for lower-level REST-based control of Splunk.
  # For most use, you will want to use +Context+'s subclass +Service+, which
  # provides convenient access to Splunk's various collections and entities.
  #
  # To use the +Context+ class, create a new +Context+ with a hash of arguments 
  # giving the details of the connection, and call the +login+ method on it:
  #
  #     context = Splunk::Context.new(:username => "admin",
  #                                   :password => "changeme").login()
  #
  # +Context+#+new+ takes a hash of keyword arguments. The keys it understands
  # are:
  #
  # * +:username+ - log in to Splunk as this user (no default)
  # * +:password+ - password to use when logging in (no default)
  # * +:host+ - Splunk host (e.g. "10.1.2.3") (default: 'localhost')
  # * +:port+ - the Splunk management port (default: 8089)
  # * +:protocol+ - either :https or :http (default: :https)
  # * +:namespace+ - a +Namespace+ object representing the default namespace for
  #   this context (default: +DefaultNamespace+)
  # * +:token+ - a preauthenticated Splunk token (default: +nil+)
  #
  # If you specify a token, you need not specify a username or password, nor
  # do you need to call the +login+ method.
  #
  # +Context+ provides three other important methods:
  #
  # * +connect+ opens a socket to the Splunk server.
  # * +request+ issues a request to the REST API.
  # * +restart+ restarts the Splunk server and handles waiting for it to come
  #   back up.

    # Issues an HTTP(S) request to the Splunk instance.

    # The +request+ method does not take a URL. Instead, it takes a hash of 
    # optional arguments specifying an action in the REST API. This avoids the 
    # problem knowing whether a given piece of data is URL encoded or not.
    #
    # The arguments are:
    #
    # * +method+: The HTTP method to use (one of +:GET+, +:POST+, or +:DELETE+;
    #   default: +:GET+).
    # * +namespace+: The namespace to request a resource from Splunk in. Must
    #   be a +Namespace+ object. (default: the value of @+namespace+ on
    #   this +Context+)
    # * +resource+: An array of strings specifying the components of the path
    #   to the resource after the namespace. The strings should not be URL
    #   encoded, as that will be handled by +request+. (default: [])
    # * +query+: A hash containing the values to be encoded as
    #   the query (the part following "?") in the URL. Nothing should be URL
    #   encoded as +request+ will do the encoding. If you need to pass multiple
    #   values for the same key, insert them as an Array as the value of their
    #   key into the Hash, and they will be properly encoded as a sequence of
    #   entries with the same key. (default: {})
    # * +headers+: A hash containing the values to be encoded as headers. None
    #   should be URL encoded, and the +request+ method will automatically add
    #   headers for +User-Agent+ and Splunk authentication for you. Keys must
    #   be unique, so the values must be strings, not arrays, unlike for
    #   +query+. (default: {})
    # * +body+: Either a hash to be encoded as the body of a POST request, or
    #   a string to be used as the raw, already encoded body of a POST request.
    #   If you pass a hash, you can pass multiple values for the same key by
    #   encoding them as an Array, which will be properly set as multiple
    #   instances of the same key in the POST body. Nothing in the hash should
    #   be URL encoded, as +request+ will handle all such encoding.
    #   (default: {})
    #
    # If Splunk responds with an HTTP code 2xx, the +request+ method returns 
    # an HTTP response object (the import methods of which are +code+, 
    # +message+, and +body+, and +each+ to enumerate over the response 
    # headers). If the HTTP code is not 2xx, +request+ raises a 
    # +SplunkHTTPError+.

    #
