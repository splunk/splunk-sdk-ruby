module Splunk
  ##
  # A class to represent a Splunk asynchronous search job.
  #
  # The most important methods on +Job+ beyond those provided by +Entity+
  # are those that fetch results (+results+, +preview+), and those that control
  # the job's execution (+cancel+, +pause+, +unpause+, +finalize+).
  #
  # Note that jobs are created with preview disabled by default. You need to
  # call +enable_preview+ and wait for the field +"isPreviewEnabled"+ to be
  # +"1"+ before you will get anything useful from +preview+.
  #
  class Job < Entity
    def initialize(service, sid)
      super(service, Splunk::namespace(:sharing => "global"), PATH_JOBS, sid)
      refresh() # Jobs don't return their state on creation
    end

    ##
    # Cancel this search job.
    #
    # Cancelling the job stops the search and deletes the results cache.
    #
    # Returns nothing.
    #
    def cancel
      begin
        control(:action => "cancel")
      rescue SplunkHTTPError => err
        if err.code == 404

        end
      end
    end

    ##
    # Issue a control request to this job.
    #
    # _args_ should be a hash with at least the key +:action+ (with a value such
    # as +"cancel"+ or +"setpriority"+).
    #
    # Returns: the +Job+.

    ##
    # Returns the raw events found by this search job.
    #
    # These events are the data from the search pipeline before the first
    # "transforming" search command. This is the primary method for a client
    # to fetch a set of _untransformed_ events from a search job. This call is
    # only valid if the search has no transforming commands.
    #
    # If the job is not yet finished, this will return an empty set of events.
