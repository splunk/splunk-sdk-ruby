# Provides a class +Index+ to represent indexes on the Splunk server.

module Splunk
  ##
  # Class representing an index on the Splunk server.
  #
  # Beyond what its superclass +Entity+ provides, +Index+ also exposes methods
  # to write data to an index and delete all data from an index.
  #
  class Index < Entity
    # Open a socket to write events to this index.
    #
    # Write events to the returned stream Socket, and Splunk will index the
    # data. You can optionally pass a hash of _host_, _source_, and
    # _sourcetype_ arguments to be sent with every event.
    #
    # Splunk may not index submitted events until the socket is closed or
    # at least 1MB of data has been submitted.
    #
    # You are responsible for closing the socket.
    #
    # Note that +SSLSocket+ and +TCPSocket+ have incompatible APIs.
    #
    # Returns: an +SSLSocket+ or +TCPSocket+.
    #
    # *Example*:
    #
    #     service = Splunk::connect(:username => 'admin', :password => 'foo')
    #     stream = service.indexes['main'].attach(:sourcetype => 'mysourcetype')
    #     (1..5).each { stream.write("This is a cheezy event\r\n") }
    #     stream.close()
    #

    # when it grows to a certain size, or when +roll_hot_buckets+ is called,
    # it is rolled to "warm" and a new hot bucket created. Warm buckets are
    # fully accessible, but not longer receiving new events. Eventually warm
    # buckets are archived to become cold buckets.

    # Upload a file accessible by the Splunk server.

    # optional arguments, all of which take +String+s:
    #
    # * +:host+ - The host for the events
    # * +:host_regex+ - A regex to be used to extract a 'host' field from
    #   the path. If the path matches this regular expression, the captured
    #   value is used to populate the 'host' field or events from this data
    #   input.  The regular expression must have one capture group.
    # * +:host_segment+ - Use the specified slash-seperated segment of the
    #   path as the host field value.
    # * +:rename-source+ - The value of the 'source' field to be applied to the
    #   data from this file
    # * +:sourcetype+ - The value of the 'sourcetype' field to be applied to
    #   data from this file
