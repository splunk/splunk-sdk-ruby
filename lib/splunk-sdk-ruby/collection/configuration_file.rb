  # ConfigurationFile is a collection containing configuration stanzas.

  # This class's API is identical to +Collection+, so a user should not
  # have to be aware of its existance.

  class ConfigurationFile < Collection # :nodoc:
    # This class is unusual: it is the element of a collection itself,
    # and its elements are entities.
