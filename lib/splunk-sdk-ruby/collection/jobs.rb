  # Class representing a search job in Splunk.
  #
  # +Jobs+ adds two additional methods to +Collection+ to start additional
  # kinds of search job. The basic +create+ method starts a normal,
  # asynchronous search job. The two new methods, +create_oneshot+ and
  # +create_stream+, creating oneshot and streaming searches, respectively,
  # which block until the search finishes and return the results directly.
  #

      # list all, not -1.

    # Create an asynchronous search job.
    #
    # The search job requires a _query_, and takes a hash of other, optional
    # arguments, which are documented in the {Splunk REST documentation}[http://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/RESTAPI/RESTsearch#search.2Fjobs - POST].

                                    "create_oneshot or create_stream instead.")

    #
    # +create_oneshot+ starts a search _query_, and any optional arguments
    # specified in a hash (which are identical to those taken by +create+).
    # It then blocks until the job finished, and returns the results, as
    # transformed by any transforming search commands in _query_ (equivalent
    # to calling the +results+ method on a +Job+).
    #
    # Returns: a stream readable by +ResultsReader+.

    end

    # Create a blocking search without transforming search commands.
    #
    # +create_export+ starts a search _query_, and any optional arguments
    # specified in a hash (which are identical to those taken by +create+).
    # It then blocks until the job is finished, and returns the events
    # found by the job before any transforming search commands (equivalent
    # to calling +events+ on a +Job+).
