##
# Control which XML parsing library the Splunk SDK for Ruby uses.
#
# The Splunk SDK for Ruby can use either REXML (the default library that
# ships with Ruby 1.9) or Nokogiri (a binding around the C library +libxml2+).
# Which library it tries is determined by the +$defualt_xml_library+ global
# variable.
#
# By default, this module will try to set the library to Nokogiri, and, if
# that is unavailable, will fall back to REXML. The library can be selected
# explicitly (in which case it will not use the fail back behavior) by calling
# +require_xml_library+ (which you should use in preference to setting
# +$default_xml_library+ manually, since it also takes care of checking that
# the library loads properly).
#
# You can also specify the environment variable +$RUBY_XML_LIBRARY+ in the shell
# to choose the default library. The two values are +"rexml"+ and +"nokogiri"+
# (note that they are not case sensitive). If you specify this environment
# variable, the SDK will not attempt to fall back to REXML in the absence of
# Nokogiri.

  # Tell the Splunk SDK for Ruby to use _library_ for XML parsing.
  #
  # The only two supported libraries for now are Nokogiri (pass +:nokogiri+ as
  # the _library_ parameter) and REXML (pass +:rexml+).
  #
  # Arguments:
  # * _library_: (+:nokogiri+ or +:rexml:+) A symbol specifying the library.
  #
  # Raises:
  # * +LoadError+ if the library requested cannot be loaded.
  #
  # Returns no value of interest.

  # Return the text contained in the first element matching _xpath_ in _text_.

  # Arguments:
  # * _xpath_: (+String+) An XPath specifier. It should refer to an element
  #   containing only text, not additional XML elements.
  # * _text_: (+String+) The text to search in.
  #
  # Returns: A +String+ containing the text in the first match of _xpath_,
  # or +nil+ if there was no match.

  # *Examples*:
  #
  #     text_at_xpath("/set/entry", "<set><entry>Boris</entry></set>")
  #       == "Boris"
  #     text_at_xpath("/a", "<a>Alpha</a> <a>Beta</a>") == "Alpha"
  #     text_at_xpath("/a", "<b>Quill pen</b>") == nil
